Using this method the server should only let us receive the data and not change its state. Hence it is only used to view something and not to change it. Get method is one of the most used HTTP method. The request parameter of the get method is appended to the URL. Get request is better for the data which does not need to be secure (It means the data which does not contain images or word documents).\n",
