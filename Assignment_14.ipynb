Each thread runs independently, and the operating system scheduler decides the order in which the threads execute.\n",

        "3. Here are the explanations of the following functions from the `threading` module in Python :\n",
        "* **`run()` :** This is the method that is executed when a thread starts. It is typically overridden by a subclass of the `Thread` class to implement the desired behavior of the thread. The `run()` method should not be called directly, instead, the `start()` method should be called to start the thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`start()` :** This method starts a thread by calling its `run()` method in a separate thread of execution. Once started, the thread executes in the background, and the main program continues to run. A thread can be started only once, and attempting to start it again will raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`join()` :** This method blocks the calling thread until the thread being joined has completed its execution. This is useful for coordinating the execution of multiple threads or for waiting for a thread to complete before continuing with the rest of the program. The `join()` method takes an optional timeout argument that specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the thread to complete. If the thread does not complete within the specified timeout period, the `join()` method returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`isAlive()` :** This method returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the thread is currently executing. It returns `True` if the thread is still running and `False` otherwise. This method can be used to check the status of a thread, for example, to determine whether a thread has completed its execution before calling the `join()` method."

        "  - **Responsiveness :** Multithreading can improve a program's responsiveness by allowing tasks that are not dependent on each other to run simultaneously. This means that the program can continue to accept input or respond to user actions even while it is performing other tasks.\n",
        "  - **Resource sharing :** Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory and files, which can save memory and improve resource utilization.\n",

        "* **Disadvantages of Multithreading :**\n",
        "  - **Complex to design :** Multithreaded programs can be complex to design and debug. Synchronization between threads to avoid race conditions, deadlocks and other concurrency issues can be tricky to manage.\n",
        "  - **Resource contention :** Multithreading can cause resource contention issues, such as multiple threads competing for access to the same resources such as memory, files, or devices. This can lead to reduced performance, race conditions, deadlocks, and other issues.\n",
        "  - **Increased memory usage :** Multithreading can increase memory usage, as each thread requires its own stack space and data structure to manage the thread.\n",
        "  - **Difficulty of debugging :** Multithreaded programs can be more difficult to debug than single-threaded programs. Synchronization and data sharing issues can be difficult to detect and reproduce, and debugging tools are not always effective for multithreaded programs."
